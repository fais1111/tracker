 * @file firestore.rules
 * @description Firestore Security Rules for the ModuleTrack application.
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. A user's
 * role, specifically whether they are an 'admin', dictates their permissions.
 * Administrative privileges are determined by the corresponding
 * document in the `/roles_admin` collection. This provides a clear, database-driven
 * way to manage high-level permissions. Regular users have read-only access to
 * shared data and can only manage their own user profile.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * The data is organized into three distinct top-level collections:
 * - `/modules/{moduleId}`: Contains the core application data for tracking modules.
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores individual user profile information.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: A lookup collection where the existence of a
 *   document signifies that the user is an administrator.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - Admin Role Management: The `/roles_admin` collection is the single source
 *   of truth for admin status. To prevent client-side privilege escalation, this
 *   collection is read-only for all users. Admin roles must be managed via a
 *   trusted server environment (e.g., using the Firebase Admin SDK).
 * - Module Access: The modules collection is publicly readable and writable for this
 *   version of the application.
 * - User Data Privacy: Users can create and update their own profile in the `/users`
 *   collection. Listing all users is explicitly forbidden to protect user privacy.
 *
 * ## Denormalization for Authorization
 * The primary use of denormalization for authorization is the `/roles_admin`
 * collection. Instead of relying on slow and costly custom claims, a simple and
 * fast `exists()` check against this collection determines if a user is an admin,
 * making rules across the database efficient and easy to understand.
