/**
 * @file firestore.rules
 * @description Firestore Security Rules for the ModuleTrack application.
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset implements a completely open model for the `modules` collection,
 * as there is no user authentication in the application. This allows any client
to perform read, create, update, and delete operations on module data.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * The data is organized into three distinct top-level collections:
 * - `/modules/{moduleId}`: Contains the core application data for tracking modules. This is publicly accessible.
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores individual user profile information. Access is restricted.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: A lookup collection for administrative roles. Access is restricted.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - Public Module Access: The `/modules` collection is intentionally open for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
 * - User Data Privacy: The `/users` and `/roles_admin` collections remain protected, although they are not currently used by the application, to prevent unauthorized access.
