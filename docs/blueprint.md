# **App Name**: ModuleTrack

## Core Features:

- Data Import: Import module data from spreadsheets, ensuring all fields (Yard, Location, Module No., etc.) are correctly parsed and stored.
- Progress Tracking: Allow users to update the status of each module with dates and notes.
- Dynamic Reporting: Generate YARD, ISLAND, and COMBINED reports automatically from user inputs, updated status and other related informations.
- Data Filtering and Search: Implement filters for searching modules based on various criteria (e.g., Location, Module No., Date Range, Shipment No#, RFLO Date Status).
- User Authentication: Implement a secure login system for multiple users with role-based access control (e.g., admin, read-only).
- Anomaly Detection: Use a generative AI tool to predict and flag unusual patterns in the module tracking data, such as unexpected delays, or inconsistencies in the progress notes based on similar data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) for a professional and reliable feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight important actions and status indicators.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for clear data presentation and readability.
- Use a consistent set of material design icons to represent module status, actions, and categories.
- Employ a grid-based layout with clearly defined sections for data input, filtering, and reporting.
- Use subtle transition animations to indicate status changes or data updates.
